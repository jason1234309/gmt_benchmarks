**After Fasm2bels is successfully run, a diff between the original bitstream's FASM file and the fasm2bels generated FASM file is helfpul in knowing what Fasm2bels did not do correctly. The descriptions are not meant to be exhaustive but rather to show a brief summary of any differences.

*Issues with files:

* mips(opensource) - Ports are minimal and so Vivado totally optimizes away the design.
* mips(hal) - Vivado says the design was build for simulation and cannot be used for synthesis
* s38584 - Too many ports for a device supported by Prjxray
* rs232 - bitCell_cntrH in u_xmit.v is driven by multiple nets

# How to create new Benchmarks

* Send through Vivado to create a bitstream:
  * Use this tcl command to place input/output ports of the chip: 
    * `place_ports [get_ports *]`
  * Use this tcl command to get a utilization report of the placed and routed design
    * `report_utilization -file ./utilization_report.txt`
  * Write a DCP checkpoint and a bitstream
* If cell libraries do not exist for the given Verilog file:
  * Copy `GMT_LOCATION/gmt/fasm2bels/trusthub_testing/gmt_trusthub_library.v` to the RTL folder of the design
  * If there still missing cells, look up the ASIC cell the Verilog is referencing and create a new Verilog model for it in the gmt_trusthub_library.v file.
* Run script to run fasm2bels analysis:
  * `source GMT_LOCATION/gmt/fasm2bels/trusthub_testing/fasm2bels_run_and_compare.py [bit file] [fasm2bels main directory path] [prjxray main directory path] [conda environment used with fasm2bels]`
  * Be sure to use `source` because Conda environments cannot be turned on/off without sourcing the script.
  * prjxray has recently been formatting their database in a way that messes with fasm2bels. It may be neccessary to copy the node_wires.json, tileconn.json, and tilegrid.json files from the general part folder (prjxray/database/artix7/xc7a200t) to the part specific folder (prjxray/database/artix7/xc7a200tffg1156-1).
  * Script will create a build directory containing fasm2bels output files and a report directory containing logs of the different processes
* Alternatively, fasm2bels maybe run on one's own.
  * Use prjxray's bit2fasm.py to create a FASM file
  * Use fasm2bels to read in the FASM file and create the output Verilog and XDC files
